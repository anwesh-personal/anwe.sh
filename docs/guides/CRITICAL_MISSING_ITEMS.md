# 🚨 CRITICAL MISSING ITEMS - Being Fixed Now

## What I Found Missing:

1. ❌ **Backend Template Generation** - SaaS Builder only downloads JSON, doesn't actually generate template files
2. ❌ **Migration Runner** - Referenced in package.json but file doesn't exist
3. ❌ **Environment Files** - No .env.example files
4. ❌ **Dockerfiles** - Referenced in docker-compose.yml but don't exist
5. ❌ **Utils Folder** - Missing entirely

## Fixing ALL of these now...
